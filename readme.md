# Portfolio Elementor Addon

This plugin was developed to meet specific client requirements, as no existing add-on fully addressed their needs. The plugin is designed to manage and display portfolio items with advanced filtering, AJAX, and pagination features. It utilizes color-thief to dynamically extract dominant colors from images and displays them within the portfolio items.


## Features

- Dynamic Color Extraction: Uses the color-thief library to extract colors from images. Includes the Color Thief script for color analysis:  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/color-thief/2.3.0/color-thief.min.js?ver=2.3.0" id="color-thief-js"></script>

- Custom Post Type Portfolio Integration: Integrates with ACF to manage and display portfolio items.
- Filtering Options: Allows users to filter portfolio items based on various attributes.
- AJAX Support: Supports AJAX for smoother user interactions without page reloads.
- Pagination: Adds custom pagination to navigate through multiple pages of portfolio items.

## Limitations and Scope for Improvement

This plugin was built quickly to meet an immediate requirement, and while it functions as intended, itâ€™s not optimized with best practices in mind. Here are some areas where improvements could be made:

- Object-Oriented Structure: The plugin could be refactored using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to improve modularity and readability.
- Design Patterns: Implementing design patterns, such as the Singleton Pattern, could manage single instances where needed, - making the code more efficient.
- Autoloader Setup: A Composer-based autoloader would streamline the inclusion of files and dependencies, enhancing performance and organization.
- Documentation: Detailed internal documentation could be added to help other developers understand and extend the code.

## Disclaimer

This plugin was developed for a specific project and may not work for general use without modification. It requires setup within ACF for specific custom fields and a "portfolio" post type. Users may need to adjust these configurations based on their own setup.
